I got extremely tired of seeing innacurate moonshining scripts, so I decided to make one of my own.
This is a modified version of wn_crafting using base game props and realistic recipes for moonshining.
I have included the images and item lists for new qb-inventory and ox_inventory.

I can offer no support on this script, as I did not write the original. This is only a configuration specifically for moonshining. 
Please refer back to original author for support.
